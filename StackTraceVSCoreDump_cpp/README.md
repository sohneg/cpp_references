# StackTrace vs CoreDump

This repository serves as a demonstration and guide on understanding and utilizing both stack trace and core dump in a C++ program. The goal is to showcase the differences between them and provide insights into their usage for effective debugging.

## Introduction
Understanding how to utilize stack trace and core dump is crucial for debugging C++ programs effectively. Stack traces help identify the call sequence leading to an issue, while core dumps provide a snapshot of the program's memory at the time of a crash.

This repository contains examples and instructions to demonstrate the differences between stack trace and core dump and how to leverage them for debugging purposes.

## Prerequisites
Ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:
- C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
- GNU Debugger (GDB)

## Compilation
Compile the example programs with debugging information using the following commands:

```bash
# For StackTrace example
g++ -g -o StackTrace StackTrace.cpp

# For CoreDump example
g++ -g -o CoreDump CoreDump.cpp
```

## Debugging with GDB
Use GDB to debug the compiled programs. The following steps illustrate debugging using GDB:

  ``Further instructions for stack trace and core dump debugging can be found in the respective sections.``

### StackTrace

1. **Start GDB with the executable:**
   ```bash
   gdb ./StackTrace
   ```

2. **Set a breakpoint and run the program:**
   ```bash
   break main
   run
   ```

### CoreDump

1. **Start GDB with the executable and core dump file:**
   ```bash
   gdb ./CoreDump /path/to/core/dump/file
   ```
   Replace `/path/to/core/dump/file` with the actual path and filename of your core dump file.

2. **Analyze the Core Dump:**
   In GDB, use the `bt` (backtrace) command to view the call stack:
   ```bash
   bt
   ```
   This will display the stack trace, showing the functions called at the time of the crash. Analyzing the stack trace can help identify the source of the segmentation fault.



## Examples
### StackTrace
The StackTrace example showcases how to capture and analyze a stack trace at a specific point in the program, particularly before handling exceptions. Use the provided guide in the README for a detailed walkthrough.

### CoreDump
The CoreDump example illustrates the generation and analysis of a core dump. It provides insights into the state of the program's memory at the time of a crash.
